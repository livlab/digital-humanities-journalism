# digital-humanities-journalism
We are collecting what digital humanities and news nerds would want to explore together and how we might facilitate it. Please add ideas/questions to https://github.com/livlab/digital-humanities-journalism/issues

This discussion started with Joe Germuska: 
**"Seems like some kind of meeting of the tribes between news nerds and digital humanities folks would pay off nicely."**

## projects / examples

* [LOTR Project](http://lotrproject.com/) - this is AMAZING: the lord of the rings in data 
* [What would happen if historians made their research notes public?](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
* [Structured Stories](http://www.structuredstories.com/) - reporting *in* structured data instead of attempting post-publication; running an experiment this summer in NYC to see if it's a viable model for news.
* [Explaain](http://explaain.com/) - Jeremy Evans' new project exploring reporting around issues instead of breaking news events; [journalism.co.uk writeup](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/issues-not-news-how-explaain-wants-to-reinvent-the-article/s2/a565019/)
* [Google Living Stories](http://livingstories.googlelabs.com/) - about 5 years old now but shows one possible presentation of news as connected storylines.
* [The Refugee Project](http://www.therefugeeproject.org/#) - mapping migrations over time with related stories (here, events and headlines)
* [Space Log](http://spacelog.org/) - Read the stories of early space exploration from the original transcripts. Now open to the public in a searchable, linkable format.
* [Ontomedia] (http://contextus.net/) and the work of Faith Lawrence & Mike Jewell - the former is in the Digital Humanities faculty at Kings College London, Mike Jewell is at Southampton University, both have been v influential in DH & narrative circles

### BBC
* [Arab Spring Storyline](http://story-newshack.rhcloud.com/) - from the first [News Labs](http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk) hack - [#16 in the list here](http://newshack.co.uk/newshack-2013/hacks/), an example visualization built on [BBC's Storyline ontology](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/storyline). This is a take on explaining key events in the Arab Spring through a mix of pull quotes, maps, timelines and charts.
* [Stories Ontology](http://contextus.net/stories) - a model (predating Storyline) which is more focused on interpretations of events (i.e. useful for more subjective claims about stuff)
* [Home Front](http://homefront.ch.bbc.co.uk/) - BBC website for a radio program on world war I allows exploration via characters, events, places involved, using storyline ontology.
* [Mythology Engine](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2010/03/the-mythology-engine-represent.shtml) - early project structuring Doctor Who as storylines. Site is up but behind a login - ask @r4isstatic for a login to the site if you're interested.

### Academic centres of practice
* [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History & New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu) at George Mason University
* [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland
